# Weasytoon

Weasytoon is an open-source mobile application developed with Flutter that allows you to create frame-by-frame image animations. It is currently available on Google Play for Android smartphones.

## Installation

To install Weasytoon, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Google Play Weasytoon page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weasytoon) on your Android smartphone.
2. Follow the prompts to install it on your device.

## Animation with Weasytoon

The concept of animation with Weasytoon is similar to that of the EasyToon software.

1. Start by creating a new image on the blank canvas, where you can draw your character, scenery, or anything you desire.
2. Once the first image is complete, create a new image to continue the animation. Each new image starts from scratch.
3. The goal is to create movement by sequentially drawing frames. To assist you, the previous image is displayed as a transparent overlay, known as onion skinning.
4. Once all your images are drawn, you can play the animation to see the result.

## Exporting an Animation as a GIF

On the "My Animations" view, use the "Export as GIF" button for a selected animation to export it in GIF format. You can then open it in your device's gallery and share it on social media or on WorldAnim.

## Feedback and Updates

Weasytoon is still in its early stages and will continue to evolve. Feel free to send your feedback, as this documentation will be updated along with the application's progress.
